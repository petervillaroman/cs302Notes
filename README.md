# Fall '23 CS 302 notes

A collection of markdown notes taken during lecture. This is for Beiyu Lin's Fall 2023 CS302. If you aren't in that class, skedadle!

## Lecture folder

This is where you'll find the notes I took for the lectures I attended. I make no promises that they are the complete 1 for 1 copy of whatever Professor Lin talked about that day but it's what I was able to write down. 

## Other things in the repo
These are just files I created that could possibly help me during the semester. Namely the two I have there at the moment: THINGS I DONT GET and some other test resource file. 

Anyway, I hope this helps even a few of you!
