# binary tree

## maximum height of full binary tree with n nodes

for 11 nodes, the maximum height is 5


- what is the height of a complete binary tree that contains N nodes? 

Order can be applied to any function. It doesn't just apply to running time. 


## checking whether a binary tree is a binary search tree will be on the test


# LEARN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN Binary tree, complete binary tree, full binary tree, perfect binary tree

sqrt(14) =
